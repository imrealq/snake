### Why this?
The pet project was inspried by this [article](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/02/programming-project-5-snake/), it helps me more understand about OOP, specially in python class and vision (or thinking) before hand on writing scripts. Some problems were quite interest such as:

* how to make snake run and change directions and make snake step through the wall and appear.
* snake eats apple and game over conditions
* choose random apple with recursion

### Print Snake eats Apple on terminal.

### Why this?
The pet project was inspried by this [article](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/02/programming-project-5-snake/), it helps me more understand about OOP, specially in python class and vision (or thinking) before hand on writing scripts. Some problems were quite interest such as:
    * how to make snake run and change directions and make snake step through the wall and appear.
    * snake eats apple and game over conditions
    * choose random apple with recursion ( correct me if i'm wrong )

### Some notes

By now, can not control snake because i did not figue out how to press key board without hit enter and plays on terminal is not good experience.

On desktop, need more time to familize with Tinker.

Further, if I will do this on website, JavaScript may be a better choice.

On smartphone, hmm... Don't know how in June 01 2021.
